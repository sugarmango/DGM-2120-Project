<h2>What about baby the littler ones?!</h2>
<p>Of course we have a special place for the littler ones ages 1-3 years old. We believe in the importance of learning at a very tender age so they can be ready to take on the world. You can find more information about early development <a href="https://www.zerotothree.org/resources/221-getting-ready-for-school-begins-at-birth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. There are many benefits related to early education for toddlers, including the following:</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>Self-Confidence</strong></dt>
<dd>The knowledge children get when they learn something new gives them the confidence to keep on the path of discovery, take on new challenges, and even make friendships. </dd>
<dt><strong>Language Skills</strong></dt>
<dd>Being exposed to new sounds, words, gestures, and activities help children develop a broader language and literacy skills when they are ready to start reading.</dd>
<dt><strong>Problem-Solving Skills</strong></dt>
<dd>When children are exposed to new activities, they gain new experiences that help them solve future problems they encounter. A little knowledge and experience mixed with creativity allows them to find new ways to solve a problem. </dd>
